Coders use this web-based basic scripting language to program the backend of websites like Y ouT ube, Instagram, Pinterest, and Quora.\\n•Java: Java places second on the list and for good reason — it can run on many devices. If you have an Android phone, all of your apps are running Java. Big data technologies are using Java as their language of choice because of its excellent capabilities of compiling and organizing data.•C: This language is one of the first high-level languages developed and is fast, structured, portable, and has a rich library. All of these features allow C to have applications across every domain in the world of programming. C is used in all the operating systems in your computer and your cellphone and even in programming robots.\\n•C++: This programming language is an object-oriented programming language that incorporates all the features of C. C++ is used for operating systems, games, embedded software, autonomous cars, and medical technology, as well as many other applications. Companies like Facebook and Google use C++.AUTOMOBILE SECTOR•there is CAD programming/automation , CFD automation, SAP , Excel programming (marco with VB), Matlab coding, Matlab GUI programming for tool development, Simulink and state flow•advent of driverless and other next generation vehicles will increase reliance on software code•C and C++ are the dominant programming languages in the automotive world. MISRA C, MISRA C++ and the AUTOSAR C++ Coding Guidelines are the main coding standards.https://www.expresscomputer.in/interviews/how-has-the-defence-sector-adopted-to-technology/61072/DEFENCE SECTOR•Python is a key asset in the toolbox of most Aerospace, Defense and Military (ADM) engineers•Cyber Security-military systems need to be hardened against cyberattacks, which can lead to loss of classified information and damage to defense systems•Modeling & Simulation - from wargaming simulation to modeling six degrees of freedom for aerial vehicles, there is a wide range of computer assisted engineering tasks that Python can help with. •Target Recognition - Identifying the position, behavior and friend/foe status of targets is essential to battlefield dominance.•Sensor Data Analysis/Visualization - airborne drones and battlefield sensors provide a wealth of information that must be analyzed in real time to be useful.•Equipment Diagnostics - all equipment eventually fails, but when it fails in combat the consequences can be deadly.\\nActivePython Enterprise Edition for mission critical applicationsHEALTHCARE: GOOD CODE, GOOD HEALTH•Django and Flask – The Python Frameworks•Health Knowledge Graphwhich is continuously enriched using natural language processing•Python also offers high-level security, thereby keeping all the data safe and secure•ease up the workload of hospitals by managing patients, doctors, and nurses with acombination of Python and data science•Image Analysis:  Body scans are an integral part of the healthcare sector. Scans and images like MRI, X-ray, and ECG, show the doctor what the naked eye can’t see and help in diagnosing the patient. Python, along with artificial intelligence and machine learning, can be leveraged by doctors to scan these images and diagnose patients with higher levels of accuracy.DATA ANALYTICS•Python is a great language when you want to analyze large sets of data usingmachine learning algorithmsto get meaningful insights. The programming language is often preferred by data scientists because of all of the extensive libraries available such as NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy.•Healthcare apps•Disease prediction and detectionTHINGS DON’T END HEREExplore more areas ………'"
